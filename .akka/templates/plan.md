# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/akka:plan` command. See `.akka/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Component Architecture

*Filled during Phase 1 (design). Before completing this table, read the
"Choosing a component type" section in `akka-context/sdk/components/index.html.md`.*

| Domain concept / process | Component | Why this component | Rejected alternative and why not (close-call decisions) |
|--------------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| [e.g., Wallet] | Event Sourced Entity | Transaction ledger is a business requirement | Key Value Entity: no history, cannot audit |
| [e.g., Transfer process] | Workflow | Multi-step, needs compensation and a queryable status | Consumer chain: no compensation path, no status |
| [e.g., Wallets by owner query] | View | Lookup by non-id attribute across entities | Direct entity read: only works by id |

Rows for close-call decisions (entity type, view vs direct entity read,
workflow vs consumer, timed action vs workflow timer) MUST name the rejected
alternative and why it was not chosen (constitution: "Right component for the
job"). For obvious choices the last column may stay empty. Pure logic with no
state, subscription, schedule, or API surface is a plain domain class and does
not appear in this table.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
