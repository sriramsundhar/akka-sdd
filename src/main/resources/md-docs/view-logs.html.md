# View logs

Akka provides logs that you can view in the Console or access with the CLI. For each service instance we aggregate a maximum of 1MB of log data. You can capture all log output by attaching a logging provider, such as Google Cloud’s operations suite (formerly Stackdriver), as described [here](observability-exports.html#_google_cloud).

## <a href="about:blank#_aggregated_logs"></a> Aggregated logs

To view aggregated logs:

Browser
1. From the project **Dashboard**, select a deployed service.
2. From the service **Overview** page, select **Logs** from the top tab or from the left navigation menu.
The **Logs** table displays logging output, which you can filter with the control on top.
CLI With a command window set to your project, use the `akka logs` command to view the logs for a running service:

```command
akka logs <<service-name>>
```

## <a href="about:blank#_exporting_logs"></a> Exporting logs

Logs can be exported for searching, reporting, alerting and long term storage by configuring the Akka observability configuration for your project. See [here](observability-exports.html) for detailed documentation.

## <a href="about:blank#_correlating_logs"></a> Correlating logs

The JSON log messages include a `trace_id` field when tracing is [enabled](observability-exports.html#activating_tracing).

This way, the trace ID that’s passed through your components will be added to your logs. For more information on tracing, click [here](traces.html).
