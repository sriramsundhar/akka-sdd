# Guardrails

## <a href="about:blank#_overview"></a> Overview

Guardrails are runtime-enforced checks that validate what goes into and comes out of your agents.
They protect against harmful inputs — such as jailbreak attempts and prompt injection — and damaging outputs — such as toxic language, hallucinated claims, or accidental disclosure of a competitor’s product.

Unlike external validation layers that sit outside your application, Akka guardrails are **part of the runtime itself**.
You declare them in configuration, and the runtime enforces them on every interaction — whether the request targets a model, an MCP tool, or any other downstream resource.
This distinction matters: bolt-on governance fails because it depends on developers remembering to call the right library at the right time.
When governance lives in the runtime, it cannot be bypassed, forgotten, or misconfigured by individual teams.

This architecture directly supports regulatory frameworks such as the **EU AI Act**, which requires that high-risk AI systems embed risk controls into their design rather than relying on after-the-fact auditing.
Because every guardrail evaluation is recorded in logs, metrics, and traces, you get an auditable compliance trail without extra instrumentation.

## <a href="about:blank#_implementing_a_guardrail"></a> Implementing a guardrail

A guardrail implements the <a href="../_attachments/api/akka/javasdk/agent/TextGuardrail.html">`TextGuardrail` interface</a>.
It receives the input or output text as a parameter and returns a result indicating whether the text passed validation, including an explanation of why the decision was made.
These results are included in metrics and traces.
A guardrail can abort the interaction with the model, or only report the problem and continue anyway.

An example of a `Guardrail` implementation:

[ToxicGuard.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/guardrail/ToxicGuard.java)
```java
import akka.javasdk.agent.GuardrailContext;
import akka.javasdk.agent.TextGuardrail;

public class ToxicGuard implements TextGuardrail {

  private final String searchFor;

  public ToxicGuard(GuardrailContext context) {
    searchFor = context.config().getString("search-for");
  }

  @Override
  public Result evaluate(String text) {
    // this would typically be more advanced in a real implementation
    if (text.contains(searchFor)) {
      return new Result(false, "Toxic response '%s' not allowed.".formatted(searchFor));
    } else {
      return Result.OK;
    }
  }
}
```

## <a href="about:blank#_configuring_guardrails"></a> Configuring guardrails

Guardrails are enabled by configuration, so you can enforce at deployment time that certain guardrails are always active.

src/main/resources/application.conf
```conf
akka.javasdk.agent.guardrails {
  "pii guard" {                                     // (1)
    class = "com.example.guardrail.PiiGuard"        // (2)
    agents = ["planner-agent"]                      // (3)
    agent-roles = ["worker"]                        // (4)
    category = PII                                  // (5)
    use-for = ["model-request", "mcp-tool-request"] // (6)
    report-only = false                             // (7)
  }

  "toxic guard" {
    class = "com.example.guardrail.ToxicGuard"
    agent-roles = ["worker"]
    category = TOXIC
    use-for = ["model-response", "mcp-tool-response"]
    report-only = false
    search-for = "bad stuff"
  }
}
```

| **1** | Each configured guardrail has a unique name. |
| **2** | Implementation class of the guardrail. |
| **3** | Enable this guardrail for agents with these component ids. |
| **4** | Enable this guardrail for agents with these roles. |
| **5** | The type of validation, such as PII and TOXIC. |
| **6** | Where to use the guardrail, such as for the model request or model response. |
| **7** | If it didn’t pass the evaluation criteria, the execution can either be aborted or continue anyway. In both cases, the result is tracked in logs, metrics and traces. |
The implementation class of the guardrail is configured with the `class` property. The class must implement the <a href="../_attachments/api/akka/javasdk/agent/TextGuardrail.html">`TextGuardrail` interface</a>. The class may optionally have a constructor with a <a href="../_attachments/api/akka/javasdk/agent/GuardrailContext.html">`GuardrailContext`</a> parameter, which includes the name and the config section for the specific guardrail. In above code example of the `ToxicGuard` you can see how the configuration property `search-for` is read from the configuration of the `GuardrailContext` parameter.

### <a href="about:blank#_agent_selection"></a> Agent selection

You select which agents a guardrail applies to by matching `agents` or `agent-roles` configuration.

- `agents`: enabled for agents with these component ids. If `agents` contains `"*"`, the guardrail is enabled for all agents.
- `agent-roles`: enabled for agents with these roles. If `agent-roles` contains `"*"`, the guardrail is enabled for all agents that have a role, but not for agents without a role.
If both `agents` and `agent-roles` are defined, it is enough that one of them matches to enable the guardrail for an agent.

This role is defined in the `@AgentRole` annotation.

### <a href="about:blank#_names_categories_and_observability"></a> Names, categories, and observability

The name and the category are reported in logs, metrics, and traces. The `category` should classify the type of validation. It can be any value, but a few recommended categories are JAILBREAK, PROMPT_INJECTION, PII, TOXIC, HALLUCINATED, NSFW, FORMAT.

The guardrail can be enabled for certain inputs or outputs with the `use-for` property. The `use-for` property accepts the following values: `model-request`, `model-response`, `mcp-tool-request`, `mcp-tool-response`, and `*`.

## <a href="about:blank#_guardrail_of_similar_text"></a> Guardrail of similar text

The built-in <a href="../_attachments/api/akka/javasdk/agent/SimilarityGuard.html">`SimilarityGuard`</a> evaluates the text by making a similarity search in a dataset of "bad examples". If the similarity exceeds a threshold, the result is flagged as blocked.

This is how to configure the `SimilarityGuard`:

src/main/resources/application.conf
```conf
akka.javasdk.agent.guardrails {
  "jailbreak guard" {
    class = "akka.javasdk.agent.SimilarityGuard"
    agents = ["planner-agent", "weather-agent"]
    category = JAILBREAK
    use-for = ["model-request"]
    threshold = 0.75
    bad-examples-resource-dir = "guardrail/jailbreak"
  }
}
```
Here, it’s using predefined examples of jailbreak prompts in `guardrail/jailbreak`. Those have been incorporated from [https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms](https://github.com/verazuo/jailbreak_llms/), but you can define your own examples and place in a subdirectory of `src/main/resources/`. All text files in the configured `bad-examples-resource-dir` are included in the similarity search.

You can use this for other things than jailbreak attempt detection.
