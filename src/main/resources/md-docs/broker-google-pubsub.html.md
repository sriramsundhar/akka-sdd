# Using Google Cloud Pub/Sub as message broker

To configure access to your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker for your Akka project, you need to create a Google service account with access to your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker and provide it to Akka.

Details on doing this can be found in the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts). We provide simplified steps below.

The service account should allow for the `roles/pubsub.editor` [role](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#roles).

## <a href="about:blank#set-pubsub-service"></a> Setting up the service account

To set up a service account and generate the key, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. From the blue bar, click the dropdown menu next to **Google Cloud Platform**.
3. Click **New Project** to create a project and save the `<gcp-project-id>`, which you will need later.
4. Enter the following `gcloud` command to set up the `gcloud` environment:

```command
gcloud auth login
gcloud projects list
gcloud config set project <gcp-project-id>
```
5. Enter the following command to create the service account. The example uses the name `akka-broker`, but you can use any name.

```command
gcloud iam service-accounts create akka-broker
```
6. Enter the following commands to grant the GCP Pub/Sub editor role to the service account. Substitute your project ID for `<gcp-project-id>`.

```command
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <gcp-project-id> \
    --member "serviceAccount:akka-broker@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role "roles/pubsub.editor"
```
7. Generate a key file for your service account:

```command
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create keyfile.json \
    --iam-account akka-broker@<gcp-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
Now you have a service account key file with which to configure Akka to use your Google Cloud Pub/Sub broker. You can add the key file using either the Akka Console or the Akka CLI.

Browser
1. Open the project in the Akka Console.
2. Select **Integrations** from the left-hand navigation menu.
3. Click **+** for the Google Cloud Pub/Sub integration option.
4. Copy the contents of `keyfile.json` into the editor and, click **Apply**.
The project is now configured to use Google Pub/Sub as the message broker.

CLI
```command
akka projects config set broker \
  --broker-service google-pubsub \
  --gcp-key-file keyfile.json \
  --description "Google Pub/Sub in <gcp-project-id>"
```
The project is now configured to use Google Pub/Sub as the message broker.

### <a href="about:blank#_create_a_topic"></a> Create a topic

To create a topic, you can either use the Google Cloud Console, or the Google Cloud CLI.

Browser
1. Open the Google Cloud Console.
2. Go to the Pub/Sub product page.
3. Click **CREATE TOPIC** on the top of the screen.
4. Fill in the Topic ID field and choose any other options you need.
5. Click **CREATE TOPIC** in the modal dialog.
You can now use the topic to connect with Akka

Google Cloud CLI
```command
gcloud pubsub topics create TOPIC_ID
```
You can now use the topic to connect with Akka

### <a href="about:blank#_topic_and_subscription_in_separate_projects"></a> Topic and subscription in separate projects

A service might need to consume events from a topic that belongs to some other GCP project than the service key
project. This can be done by specifying a full path for the topic name in the consumer or view annotation:

```java
@Consume.FromTopic("projects/the-other-project-id/topics/the-topic-id")
```
In addition to this, the subscription may be local to the service itself, when a full path is specified as the
consumer group, that will be used as the exact subscription name:

```java
@Consume.FromTopic(
    value = "projects/the-other-project-id/topics/the-topic-id",
    consumerGroup = "projects/my-project-id/subscriptions/my-subscr-id")
```
The configured service account will need to have permissions to consume from the topic, and to use the subscription.

### <a href="about:blank#_topic_and_subscription_management_options"></a> Topic and subscription management options

By default, a deployed service expects the topic to exist, but that it can create the subscription if it does not exist yet.

It is possible to configure this in three ways, through the `application.conf` setting `akka.javasdk.eventing.google-pubsub.mode`:

```hocon
akka.javasdk.eventing.google-pubsub.mode = "automatic-subscription"
```
The following three values are valid:

- **automatic** - runtime creates topic and subscription if they do not exist
- **automatic-subscription** - runtime creates subscription if it do not exist, topic must be manually created
- **manual** - both topic and subscription must be manually created
The service account must have permissions to perform the operations for the selected mode.

## <a href="about:blank#_delivery_characteristics"></a> Delivery characteristics

When your application consumes messages from Google Pub/Sub, it will try to deliver messages to your service in 'at-least-once' fashion while preserving order.

- the GCP 'Subscription' has the 'Message ordering' flag enabled (this is the case by default for the subscriptions created by Akka)
- the code that acts as a publisher has 'message ordering' enabled (if needed on this client SDK)
- an ordering key is [provided for each message](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher#using-ordering-keys)
When passing messages to a certain entity or using them to update a view row by specifying the id as the Cloud Event `ce-subject` attribute on the message, the same id must be used for the Google Pub/Sub ordering key to guarantee that the messages are processed in order by the entity or view.

|  | Correct ordering is especially important for topics that stream directly into views using the `transform_update` option: when messages for the same subject id are spread over different ordering keys (or do not have ordering keys), they may read stale data and lose updates. |
To achieve at-least-once delivery, messages that are not acknowledged before the [Ack deadline](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber#subscription-workflow) will be redelivered. This means redeliveries of 'older' messages may arrive behind fresh deliveries of 'newer' messages.

When publishing messages to Google Pub/Sub from Akka, the `ce-subject` attribute, if present, is used as the ordering key for the message.
