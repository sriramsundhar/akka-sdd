**Views and consumers can start from snapshots**

## <a href="about:blank#_january_2026"></a> January 2026

**Smarter agents with vision and reasoning**

Agents gain [multimodal capabilities with image input support](../sdk/agents/prompt.html#_multimodal_user_message), enabling models to perceive and reason about visual content. Supported models can now be configured to enable thinking, letting agents reason through complex problems step by step. Other Akka components can be wired directly as agent tools, making it easy to give agents access to your existing business logic without writing glue code.

**Workflow notifications and a new fluent API**

Workflows get [a redesigned, more type-safe and fluent API](../sdk/workflows.html) that makes defining multi-step processes more intuitive. Workflows can now [emit streams of real-time notifications](../sdk/workflows.html#_notification) to subscribers, keeping clients and downstream systems informed as individual workflows progress through their steps.

**Console with deep observability**

The Akka console now provides detailed insights into your service structure and component interactions. [Run it in local mode](../sdk/running-locally.html#_local_console) to get full request traces showing exactly which components handle each request, along with a detailed view of how agents interact with AI models — invaluable for debugging and understanding agent behavior during development.

**Agent component**

AI agents integrate with AI to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions toward a specific goal. Agents can have varying degrees of human intervention from none (completely autonomous) to requiring a human to approve each action the agent takes.

The new [Agent](../sdk/agents.html) component is typically backed by a large language model (LLM). It maintains contextual history in a session memory, which may be shared between multiple agents that are collaborating on the same goal. It may provide function tools and call them as requested by the model.

Several agents can collaborate to achieve a common goal, and they can be orchestrated from a predefined workflow or a dynamically created plan.

**Akka’s local console more lightweight**

The latest Akka CLI versions run the local console for development without using Docker. It spins up quickly and requires almost no resources.

**New Akka SDK learning path in Akkademy**

A new course is now available in Akkademy: [Introduction to the Akka SDK](https://akkademy.akka.io/learn/courses/51/introduction-to-the-akka-sdk).

This short, self-paced course introduces the foundational concepts of the Akka SDK. It is organized into brief lessons with coding exercises that run directly in the browser, requiring no installation. The course is ideal for developers who are new to the Akka SDK and want a structured, guided approach to building services.

## <a href="about:blank#_april_2025"></a> April 2025

**Self managed deployment**

For organizations that want control over how Akka services are installed, updated, and maintained. Akka services are packaged into standalone binaries with Akka clustering for scaling and deploy to self-managed nodes. You are responsible for separately managing secure connectivity, routes, installation, deployment, and persistence.

This new deployment alternative is described in [Operate Akka in a self-managed environment](../operations/configuring.html).

**Virtual threads**

SDK running on virtual threads means it is possible to benefit from the performance of the underlying async Akka runtime, without having to use complex completion stage composition. The service code can now look like regular, simple, Java code.

The [shopping cart endpoint](../getting-started/shopping-cart/build-and-deploy-shopping-cart.html#_the_external_api) is one example of how that looks like

- [Akka Management 1.6.1](https://github.com/akka/akka-management/releases/tag/v1.6.1)

  - Support for virtual threads on Java 21

## <a href="about:blank#_march_2025"></a> March 2025

**Replication of Key Value Entities**

Akka now supports multi-region replication of [Key Value Entities](../sdk/key-value-entities.html). No code changes are needed for activating replication. This feature is disabled until the next full restart of your service (`akka service pause/resume`). It’s recommended to add the `ReadOnlyEffect` as described in [Key Value Entity replication](../sdk/key-value-entities.html#_replication).

**Service-to-service eventing for Key Value Entities**

[Service to service eventing](../sdk/consuming-producing.html#s2s-eventing) is now supported for [Key Value Entities](../sdk/key-value-entities.html). Key value changes are captured as events which can propagate state changes and information between Akka services within the same project.

**New primary selection mode**

[Request-region primary selection mode](../concepts/multi-region.html): The primary region changes when another region receives a write request. Upon a write request to an entity in a region that is not the primary it will move its primary. The new primary ensures that all preceding events from the previous primary have been fully replicated and applied (i.e. persisted) before writing the new event, and thereby guarantees strong consistency when switching from one region to another. Subsequent write requests to the primary region of the entity are handled locally without any further coordination. Write requests to other regions will trigger the same switch-over process. All other entity instances operate unimpeded during the switch-over process.

**Automatic deduplication for view updates**

When subscribing to entities and service-to-service eventing from a view, updates are now guaranteed to be processed exactly-once. This is not applicable when subscribing to topics. Additionally, a new section describing different [message deduplication](../sdk/dev-best-practices.html#message-deduplication) strategies has been added to the best practices guide.

## <a href="about:blank#_february_2025"></a> February 2025

**gRPC endpoints**

Akka now supports [gRPC endpoints](../sdk/grpc-endpoints.html) complementing [HTTP endpoints](../sdk/http-endpoints.html). gRPC services enable contract-first development where interfaces can be defined with the protobuf specification. The underlying protobuf serialization format supports backward and forward compatibility avoiding tight coupling by making it easier to evolve services without breaking existing clients. Additionally, gRPC’s supports unary and streaming calls making it a good choice for high-performance service-to-service communication.

**Serving static resources from HTTP endpoints**

HTTP endpoints can now serve static content. This enables hosting web pages, client-side applications, and other resources within the endpoint. The static content is accessible through a convenience method: [Serving static content](../sdk/http-endpoints.html#_serving_static_content). [Subtree "glob" paths](../sdk/http-endpoints.html#glob_static_content) allow serving path hierarchies.

**Server-sent events**

Server-sent events (SSE) is a way to push a stream of elements through a single HTTP response enabling an HTTP client to see each element one-by-one rather than waiting for an entire response to complete. This is useful for streaming events from a View or monitoring state changes of an entity. We have introduced an API to simplify deferred HTTP responses as a stream of [Server-sent Events (SSE)](../sdk/http-endpoints.html#sse).
