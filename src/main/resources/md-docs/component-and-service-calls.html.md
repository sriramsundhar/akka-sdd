# Component and service calls

An Akka service comprises many components. These components might depend on one another, on other Akka services, or even external services. This section describes how to call other components and services from within an Akka service.

## <a href="about:blank#_calling_akka_components"></a> Calling Akka components

Since Akka is an auto-scaling solution, components run distributed across many nodes within the same service. That’s why calls between Akka components are done via a client rather than through regular method calls. The receiving component instance may be on the same node, but it may also be on a different node.

Requests and responses are always serialized to JSON during transmission between the client and the component.

### <a href="about:blank#_component_client"></a> Component Client

The `akka.javasdk.client.ComponentClient` is a utility for making type-safe calls between components within an Akka service. To use the `ComponentClient`, you need to inject it into your component via the constructor:

[CounterEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/event-sourced-counter-brokers/src/main/java/counter/api/CounterEndpoint.java)
```java
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(principal = Acl.Principal.INTERNET))
@HttpEndpoint("/counter")
public class CounterEndpoint {

  private final ComponentClient componentClient;

  public CounterEndpoint(ComponentClient componentClient) { // (1)
    this.componentClient = componentClient;
  }

  @Get("/{counterId}")
  public Integer get(String counterId) {
    return componentClient
      .forEventSourcedEntity(counterId) // (2)
      .method(CounterEntity::get)
      .invoke(); // (3)
  }

  @Post("/{counterId}/increase/{value}")
  public HttpResponse increase(String counterId, Integer value) {
    componentClient
      .forEventSourcedEntity(counterId)
      .method(CounterEntity::increase)
      .invoke(value);

    return ok(); // (4)
  }

}
```

| **1** | Accept the `ComponentClient` as a constructor argument and keep it in a field. |
| **2** | Use a specific request builder for the component you want to call. |
| **3** | Invoking the method returns the `T` that the component eventually returns. |
| **4** | Adapt the response rather than returning it as is. In this case, you discard the response value and respond OK without a response body. |
The component client can call command handlers on Event Sourced Entities, Key Value Entities, Workflows, Timed Actions, and query methods on Views.

The component client is available for injection only in Service Setup, Agents, Endpoints, Consumers, Timed Actions, and Workflows. For more information, see [dependency injection](setup-and-dependency-injection.html#_dependency_injection).

NOTE For component client error handling, see [Errors and failures](errors-and-failures.html) section.

#### <a href="about:blank#_asynchronous_execution"></a> **Asynchronous execution**

For the vast majority of your Akka programming tasks, writing clean and simple synchronous code is all you need.

One way to think about your synchronous code is that it returns already completed futures. For example, you could rewrite the first "hello world" sample to return a Java future, e.g. `CompletionStage<String>` as follows:

```java
@Get("/hello")
public CompletionStage<String> hello() {
    return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Hello world");
}
```
Obviously, just writing simple synchronous code is easier to read and maintain. If you need to make a component client call that is explicitly asynchronous, you can use the component client’s `invokeAsync()` method, which returns a `CompletionStage<T>`. This allows you to trigger multiple calls concurrently, enabling parallel processing.

[CounterEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/event-sourced-counter-brokers/src/main/java/counter/api/CounterEndpoint.java)
```java
public record IncreaseAllThese(List<String> counterIds, Integer value) {}

@Post("/increase-multiple")
public HttpResponse increaseMultiple(IncreaseAllThese increaseAllThese) throws Exception {
  var triggeredTasks = increaseAllThese
    .counterIds()
    .stream()
    .map(
      counterId ->
        componentClient
          .forEventSourcedEntity(counterId)
          .method(CounterEntity::increase)
          .invokeAsync(increaseAllThese.value)
    ) // (1)
    .toList();

  for (var task : triggeredTasks) {
    task.toCompletableFuture().get(); // (2)
  }
  return ok(); // (3)
}
```

| **1** | Call `invokeAsync()` and collect each `CompletionStage<T>`. |
| **2** | When all tasks have been started, wait for all tasks to complete. |
| **3** | When all tasks have successfully completed, we can respond. |

#### <a href="about:blank#_synchronous_vs_asynchronous_component_invocation"></a> **Synchronous vs asynchronous component invocation**

You decide how the [component client](../reference/glossary.html#component_client) invokes the component, and the Akka runtime handles the request in the background. The following table summarizes the key differences between synchronous and asynchronous component invocation.

|  | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When the component method returns | After the method finishes | Immediately |
| Client behavior | Waits for the result before continuing | Continues immediately, must handle the result later |
| Return type | Whatever the component method returns directly | A `CompletionStage<T>` representing the result at a later time |
| Component execution | Always runs in the background | Always runs in the background |
| Common use case | Calling a method and using the result in the next line of code | Starting multiple async tasks or implementing background, always-on processes (Ambient AI) |
| Ideal for | Simple flows where the result is needed immediately | Parallel task execution, deferred response handling, or long-running background logic |

#### <a href="about:blank#_when_in_doubt_write_synchronous_code"></a> **When in doubt, write synchronous code**

Trust that Akka will do the right thing and that the runtime makes the necessary optimizations.

If you do need explicit control over futures, such as creating streams from asynchronous sources or explicitly performing parallel work, then the component client’s `invokeAsync()` and the full power of Java concurrency is there for you when you need it.

## <a href="about:blank#_calling_akka_services"></a> Calling Akka services

Calling other Akka services within the same project is done by invoking them using an HTTP or a gRPC client, depending on what type
of endpoints the service provides.

### <a href="about:blank#_calling_akka_services_over_http"></a> Calling Akka services over HTTP

The service is identified by the name it has been deployed with. Akka takes care of routing requests to the service and keeping the data safe by encrypting the connection and handling authentication for you.

In the following snippet, we have an endpoint component that calls another service named `counter`. It makes use of SDK-provided `akka.javasdk.http.HttpClientProvider` which returns HTTP client instances for calling other Akka services.

In our delegating service implementation:

[DelegatingServiceEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/DelegatingServiceEndpoint.java)
```java
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(service = "*"))
@HttpEndpoint
public class DelegatingServiceEndpoint {

  private final HttpClient httpClient;

  public DelegatingServiceEndpoint(HttpClientProvider httpClient) { // (1)
    this.httpClient = httpClient.httpClientFor("counter"); // (2)
  }

  // model for the JSON we accept
  record IncreaseRequest(int increaseBy) {}

  // model for the JSON the upstream service responds with
  record Counter(int value) {}

  @Post("/delegate/counter/{counterId}/increase")
  public String addAndReturn(String counterId, IncreaseRequest request) {
    var response = httpClient
      .POST("/counter/" + counterId + "/increase") // (3)
      .withRequestBody(request)
      .responseBodyAs(Counter.class)
      .invoke(); // (4)

    if (response.status().isSuccess()) { // (5)
      return "New counter value: " + response.body().value;
    } else {
      throw new RuntimeException("Counter returned unexpected status: " + response.status());
    }
  }
}
```

| **1** | Accept a `HttpClientProvider` parameter for the constructor. |
| **2** | Use it to look up a client for the `counter` service. |
| **3** | Use the `HttpClient` to prepare a REST call to the `counter` service endpoint. |
| **4** | Invoking the call will return a `StrictResponse<T>` with details about the result as well as the deserialized response body. |
| **5** | Handle the response, which may be successful or an error. |

|  | The HTTP client provider is only available for injection in the following types of components: HTTP Endpoints, gRPC Endpoints, Workflows, Consumers and Timed Actions. |

### <a href="about:blank#_calling_external_http_services"></a> Calling external HTTP services

Calling external services deployed on **different** Akka projects or any other external HTTP server is also done with the `HttpClientProvider`. Instead of a service name, the protocol and full server name are used when calling `httpClientFor`. For example, `https://example.com` or `http://example.com`.

[CallExternalServiceEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/CallExternalServiceEndpoint.java)
```java
package com.example.callanotherservice;

import akka.javasdk.annotations.Acl;
import akka.javasdk.annotations.http.Get;
import akka.javasdk.annotations.http.HttpEndpoint;
import akka.javasdk.http.HttpClient;
import akka.javasdk.http.HttpClientProvider;
import akka.javasdk.http.StrictResponse;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@HttpEndpoint
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(principal = Acl.Principal.ALL))
public class CallExternalServiceEndpoint {

  private final HttpClient httpClient;

  public record PeopleInSpace(List<Astronaut> people, int number, String message) {}

  public record Astronaut(String craft, String name) {}

  public record AstronautsResponse(List<String> astronautNames) {}

  public CallExternalServiceEndpoint(HttpClientProvider httpClient) { // (1)
    this.httpClient = httpClient.httpClientFor("http://api.open-notify.org"); // (2)
  }

  @Get("/iss-astronauts")
  public AstronautsResponse issAstronauts() {
    StrictResponse<PeopleInSpace> peopleInSpaceResponse = httpClient
      .GET("/astros.json") // (3)
      .responseBodyAs(PeopleInSpace.class) // (4)
      .invoke();

    var astronautNames = peopleInSpaceResponse
      .body()
      .people.stream() // (5)
      .filter(astronaut -> astronaut.craft.equals("ISS"))
      .map(astronaut -> astronaut.name)
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
    return new AstronautsResponse(astronautNames); // (6)
  }
}
```

| **1** | Accept a `HttpClientProvider` parameter for the constructor. |
| **2** | Look up a `HttpClient` for a service using `http` protocol and server name. |
| **3** | Issue a GET call to the path `/astros.json` on the server. |
| **4** | Specify a class to parse the response body into. |
| **5** | Once the call completes, handle the response. |
| **6** | Return an adapted result object which will be turned into a JSON response. |

### <a href="about:blank#_calling_akka_services_over_grpc"></a> Calling Akka services over gRPC

The service is identified by the name it has been deployed with. Akka takes care of routing requests to the service and keeping the data safe by encrypting the connection and handling authentication for you.

In this sample we will implement a gRPC endpoint that delegates a call to a [gRPC endpoint](grpc-endpoints.html) of a customer registry service, deployed with the service name `customer-registry`.

The SDK provides `akka.javasdk.grpc.GrpcClientProvider` which provides gRPC client instances for calling other services.

To consume an external gRPC service, that service’s protobuf descriptor must be added to the `src/proto` directory of the project. This
triggers generation of a client interface and Java classes for all the message types used as requests and responses for
methods in that service.

|  | Since the service protobuf descriptors need to be shared between the provider service and the consuming service, one simple option is to copy the service descriptions to each service that needs them. It is also possible to use a shared library with the protobuf descriptors. |
In our delegating service implementation:

[DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpointImpl.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/event-sourced-customer-registry-subscriber/src/main/java/customer/api/DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpointImpl.java)
```java
@GrpcEndpoint
public class DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpointImpl implements DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpoint {

  private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

  private CustomerGrpcEndpointClient customerService;

  public DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpointImpl(GrpcClientProvider clientProvider) { // (1)
    customerService = clientProvider.grpcClientFor(
      CustomerGrpcEndpointClient.class,
      "customer-registry"
    ); // (2)
  }

  @Override
  public CreateCustomerResponse createCustomer(CreateCustomerRequest in) {
    log.info("Delegating customer creation to upstream gRPC service: {}", in);
    if (in.getCustomerId().isEmpty()) throw new GrpcServiceException(
      Status.INVALID_ARGUMENT.augmentDescription("No id specified")
    );

    try {
      return customerService.createCustomer(in); // (3)
    } catch (Exception ex) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Delegate call to create upstream customer failed", ex);
    }
  }
}
```

| **1** | Accept a `GrpcClientProvider` parameter for the constructor. |
| **2** | Use the generated gRPC client interface for the service (`CustomerGrpcEndpointClient.class`) and the service name (`customer-registry`) to look up a client. |
| **3** | Use the client to call the other service and return a `CompletionStage<CreateCustomerResponse>`. |
Since the called service and the `DelegateCustomerGrpcEndpoint` share the same request and response protocol, no further transformation
of the request or response is needed here.

For dev mode and in tests, providing a config override in `application.conf` like for external calls is possible, however
when deployed such configuration is ignored.

|  | The gRPC client provider is only available for injection in the following types of components: HTTP Endpoints, gRPC endpoints, Workflows, Consumers and Timed Actions. |

### <a href="about:blank#_calling_external_grpc_services"></a> Calling external gRPC services

Calling gRPC services deployed on **different** Akka projects or any other external gRPC server is also done with the `GrpcClientProvider`. Instead of a service name, the protocol and the fully qualified DNS name of the service are used when calling `grpcClientFor`. For example `hellogrpc.example.com`.

[CallExternalGrpcEndpointImpl.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/CallExternalGrpcEndpointImpl.java)
```java
@GrpcEndpoint
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(principal = Acl.Principal.ALL))
public class CallExternalGrpcEndpointImpl implements CallExternalGrpcEndpoint {

  private final ExampleGrpcEndpointClient external;

  public CallExternalGrpcEndpointImpl(GrpcClientProvider clientProvider) { // (1)
    external = clientProvider.grpcClientFor(
      ExampleGrpcEndpointClient.class,
      "hellogrpc.example.com"
    ); // (2)
  }

  @Override
  public HelloReply callExternalService(HelloRequest in) {
    return external.sayHello(in); // (3)
  }
}
```

| **1** | Accept a `GrpcClientProvider` parameter for the constructor. |
| **2** | Use the generated gRPC client interface for the service (`ExampleGrpcEndpointClient.class`) and the service name (`doc-snippets`) to look up a client. |
| **3** | Use the client to call the other service and return a `CompletionStage<HelloReply>`. |
Since the called service and the `DelegatingGrpcEndpoint` share the same request and response protocol, no further transformation
of the request or response is needed here.

The service is expected to accept HTTPS connections and run on the standard HTTPS port (443). For calling a service on a nonstandard
port, or served unencrypted (not recommended) it is possible to define configuration overrides in `application.conf` (or `application-test.conf` specifically for tests):

[application.conf](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/resources/application.conf)
```json
akka.javasdk.grpc.client."hellogrpc.example.com" {
  # configure external call, to call back to self
  host = "localhost"
  port = 9000
  use-tls = false
}
```

## <a href="about:blank#_mocking_http_and_grpc_services_in_tests"></a> Mocking HTTP and gRPC services in tests

When integration testing a service that calls other services, the testkit can intercept lookups
via `HttpClientProvider.httpClientFor(…​)` and `GrpcClientProvider.grpcClientFor(…​)` and route
them to a user-provided mock instead of making real network calls.

The mock lookups are only populated when the runtime is started by the testkit; the default runner
used in dev mode and production cannot see any mocks, so there is no risk of a mock leaking outside
of tests.

Mocks are registered either on `TestKit.Settings` (as defaults for all tests in the class) or on
the live registries returned by `testKit.getMockedHttpServices()` and `testKit.getMockedGrpcServices()` (for per-test overrides). Calling `reset()` on a registry restores it to the defaults declared on
the settings.

### <a href="about:blank#_mocking_http_services"></a> Mocking HTTP services

Given a service that looks up an HTTP client by service name:

[DelegatingServiceEndpoint.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/DelegatingServiceEndpoint.java)
```java
@Acl(allow = @Acl.Matcher(service = "*"))
@HttpEndpoint
public class DelegatingServiceEndpoint {

  private final HttpClient httpClient;

  public DelegatingServiceEndpoint(HttpClientProvider httpClient) { // (1)
    this.httpClient = httpClient.httpClientFor("counter"); // (2)
  }

  // model for the JSON we accept
  record IncreaseRequest(int increaseBy) {}

  // model for the JSON the upstream service responds with
  record Counter(int value) {}

  @Post("/delegate/counter/{counterId}/increase")
  public String addAndReturn(String counterId, IncreaseRequest request) {
    var response = httpClient
      .POST("/counter/" + counterId + "/increase") // (3)
      .withRequestBody(request)
      .responseBodyAs(Counter.class)
      .invoke(); // (4)

    if (response.status().isSuccess()) { // (5)
      return "New counter value: " + response.body().value;
    } else {
      throw new RuntimeException("Counter returned unexpected status: " + response.status());
    }
  }
}
```
A test can declare the mocked response(s) either on `TestKit.Settings` (applied to every test in
the class) or on `testKit.getMockedHttpServices()` inside an individual test:

[DelegatingServiceEndpointMockedTest.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/test/java/com/example/callanotherservice/DelegatingServiceEndpointMockedTest.java)
```java
public class DelegatingServiceEndpointMockedTest extends TestKitSupport {

  @Override
  protected TestKit.Settings testKitSettings() {
    return TestKit.Settings.DEFAULT.withMockedHttpService( // (1)
      "counter",
      request ->
        HttpResponse.create()
          .withStatus(StatusCodes.OK)
          .withEntity(ContentTypes.APPLICATION_JSON, "{\"value\":42}")
    );
  }

  @AfterEach
  public void resetMocks() {
    testKit.getMockedHttpServices().reset(); // (2)
  }

  @Test
  public void delegatingEndpointReturnsValueFromMockedUpstream() {
    var body = new DelegatingServiceEndpoint.IncreaseRequest(1);
    var response = httpClient
      .POST("/delegate/counter/abc/increase")
      .withRequestBody(body)
      .responseBodyAs(String.class)
      .invoke();

    assertThat(response.body()).isEqualTo("New counter value: 42");
  }

  @Test
  public void delegatingEndpointFailsWhenUpstreamReturnsError() {
    testKit
      .getMockedHttpServices()
      .mockResponse( // (3)
        "counter",
        request -> HttpResponse.create().withStatus(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
      );

    var body = new DelegatingServiceEndpoint.IncreaseRequest(1);

    org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThatThrownBy(
      () -> httpClient.POST("/delegate/counter/abc/increase").withRequestBody(body).invoke()
    ).hasMessageContaining("500");
  }
}
```

| **1** | A class-wide default: every call `httpClientFor("counter")` receives this mocked response. |
| **2** | Reset between tests so per-test overrides do not leak. |
| **3** | A per-test override: replace the mock for this test only; reverts on the next `reset()`. |
The mock handler is a plain `Function<HttpRequest, HttpResponse>`. The testkit runs it on the SDK
dispatcher (virtual thread backed), so blocking inside the handler is safe.

### <a href="about:blank#_mocking_grpc_services"></a> Mocking gRPC services

For gRPC, the mock is an instance of the generated Akka gRPC client interface. The test implements
the methods it expects to be called and lets the others throw:

[CallExternalGrpcEndpointMockedTest.java](https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/blob/main/samples/doc-snippets/src/test/java/com/example/callanotherservice/CallExternalGrpcEndpointMockedTest.java)
```java
public class CallExternalGrpcEndpointMockedTest extends TestKitSupport {

  @AfterEach
  public void resetMocks() {
    testKit.getMockedGrpcServices().reset();
  }

  @Test
  public void delegatesToMockedExternalGrpcService() {
    testKit
      .getMockedGrpcServices()
      .mockResponse( // (1)
        "hellogrpc.example.com",
        ExampleGrpcEndpointClient.class,
        new ExampleGrpcEndpointMock("Hello from the mock")
      );

    var client = getGrpcEndpointClient(CallExternalGrpcEndpointClient.class); // (2)
    var response = client.callExternalService(
      HelloRequest.newBuilder().setName("Alice").build()
    );

    assertThat(response.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Hello from the mock");
  }

  /** Mock implementation of the generated Akka gRPC client interface. */(3)
  static final class ExampleGrpcEndpointMock extends ExampleGrpcEndpointClient {

    private final String reply;

    ExampleGrpcEndpointMock(String reply) {
      this.reply = reply;
    }

    @Override
    public HelloReply sayHello(HelloRequest in) {
      return HelloReply.newBuilder().setMessage(reply).build();
    }

    @Override
    public HelloReply itKeepsTalking(Source<HelloRequest, NotUsed> in) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    @Override
    public Source<HelloReply, NotUsed> itKeepsReplying(HelloRequest in) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    @Override
    public Source<HelloReply, NotUsed> streamHellos(Source<HelloRequest, NotUsed> in) {
      throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }

    @Override
    public CompletionStage<Done> close() {
      return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(Done.getInstance());
    }

    @Override
    public CompletionStage<Done> closed() {
      return new CompletableFuture<>();
    }
  }
}
```

| **1** | Register the mock for the service name (or external host, as here) the service under test passes to `grpcClientFor`. |
| **2** | Drive the local endpoint via `getGrpcEndpointClient`; when it internally looks up a gRPC client for `hellogrpc.example.com`, it receives the mock. |
| **3** | The mock extends the generated client interface, implements the methods the test exercises, and throws for the rest. |
A class-wide default can also be declared via `TestKit.Settings.withMockedGrpcService(name, clientClass, mockInstance)`, paralleling the HTTP API.
