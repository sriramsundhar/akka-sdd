# Spec-driven development

## <a href="about:blank#_overview"></a> Overview

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) turns your natural-language specifications into the single source of truth for an entire application. You write the *what* and *why*; AI generates all the code.

**What it does.** SDD provides a structured, iterative workflow — specify, clarify, plan, task, implement, build, deploy, inspect — backed by a constitution of unbreakable project rules. Every artifact is version-controlled, and automated CI can detect divergence between specification and code.

**When to use it.**

- You are building an Akka service (or set of services) that will evolve over time.
- You want repeatable, auditable AI code generation tied to formal specifications.
- Your application is complex enough that a single prompt or single-file spec is insufficient.
**When NOT to use it.**

- A quick demo or throwaway prototype — direct prompting or a single-file spec is faster.
- Your project has no AI coding assistant available.
- The entire application can be fully described in a single specification file with no ambiguity.

## <a href="about:blank#_getting_started_with_sdd"></a> Getting started with SDD

### <a href="about:blank#_step_1_install_the_akka_plugin"></a> Step 1: Install the Akka plugin

In Claude Code, install the Akka plugin from the AI Marketplace:

```none
/plugin marketplace add akka/ai-marketplace
/plugin install akka@ai-marketplace
/reload-plugins
```
This registers the Akka marketplace, installs the Akka skill (CLI, MCP server, AI coding assistant, and project scaffolding), and activates it.

|  | If you are unable to add the marketplace, clone the Akka plugin repository and add it as a local marketplace instead: `git clone https://github.com/akka/ai-marketplace.git` then `/plugin marketplace add /path/to/ai-marketplace` |

### <a href="about:blank#_step_2_set_up_your_environment"></a> Step 2: Set up your environment

```none
/akka:setup
```
+
This configures your environment — ensuring the Akka CLI is installed, Java and Maven are available, and your Akka download token is properly configured. Once setup completes, you are ready to start building.

|  | If you are unable to install the marketplace plugin or clone the repository, fall back to the Akka CLI:

  1. Install the Akka CLI (see [Install the Akka CLI](../operations/cli/installation.html)).
  2. Run `akka specify init <dir>` to provision a new AI-assist ready project.
  3. Launch your AI coding assistant from the new project directory.
The `_mcp.json` file included in the project template lets you manually register Akka as an MCP server for any compatible agent. |

## <a href="about:blank#_ai_assistance_maturity_levels"></a> AI assistance maturity levels

It helps to think of the steps in this evolution as different levels in a maturity model for AI-assisted development. Some developers experienced these levels chronologically; others jumped directly into later levels. There is no objectively right or wrong level, but this document focuses on the highest maturity level.

### <a href="about:blank#_direct_prompting"></a> Direct prompting

With direct prompting, you supply prompts to your favorite AI assistant and get generated code back. This can be useful for demonstrations and sample applications, but this level has no reliable source of truth. AI assistants are well known for producing different output for the same prompt. Attempts to move toward a reliable source of truth and decrease the random nature of the output lead to the next maturity level.

### <a href="about:blank#_single_file_specification"></a> Single-file specification

While code assistant chat logs can be saved and exported, they are unsuitable for use as a source of truth, a specification, or a document that can be committed to version control. The next evolution is typically when people create a single specification file in markdown. This file contains the entirety of an application specification, including the details on *what* is being built, *why* it is being built, and *how* it should be built (tech specifications).

This maturity level has a single source of truth (the spec file) which can be version controlled. More importantly, LLMs can judge how well the generated code conforms to the specification. Deviations above a certain threshold can fail builds and trigger human-in-the-loop workflows that may result in many iterations refining the specification.

Crucially, this single file specification is usually written mostly by humans. It becomes unwieldy once a specification reaches a certain level of complexity.

### <a href="about:blank#_formal_spec_driven_process"></a> Formal spec-driven process

A single `SPEC.md` or `specification.md` file may be enough for some projects. Many sample or demonstration applications can be built properly with just a single file. However, when your needs and complexity reach a certain point, you need a formal process. This process is iterative, git-friendly, and enlists the aid of the AI assistant both in building the spec and generating the code from it. It addresses the need to build formal specifications that are consumable by both human and AI alike while reducing random and unexpected output. This process is covered in detail below.

## <a href="about:blank#_using_akka_specify"></a> Using Akka specify

Akka makes it incredibly easy to get started with a new *Spec-Driven* project. Instead of using `akka code init`, use the newer `akka specify init` command. This will give you everything you need to kick off your Spec-Driven development cycle.

If you installed the Akka plugin (recommended), the `/akka:setup` skill handles project initialization for you. The information below describes what happens under the hood, and applies if you used the `akka specify init <dir>` fallback.

### <a href="about:blank#_initialization_and_constitution_adoption"></a> Initialization and constitution adoption

Running `akka specify init <dir>` provisions a new AI-assist ready project directory. It scaffolds an empty Akka project and grabs all of the markdown templates necessary for the spec-driven process. Once you have run this command, change to the directory of your new project (if you are not already there) and launch your favorite code assistant.

One of the important files that comes with your new project is a **constitution**. The `constitution.md` file is where unbreakable rules for the entire project are defined. This file contains mandates about technology requirements, design rules, and more. Akka gives you a default constitution that contains all of the mandatory requirements for Akka applications. In addition to the Akka-specific constitution, the initialization process lets you add an additional layer of constitution. Use this to include mandates from your company, organization, team, etc. It then becomes easy to maintain your own constitution while still benefiting from Akka’s rules.

The constitution is typically defined once at the start of a project and only refined as necessary. Constitution amendments are considered one-off exceptions and not part of the core development loop.

### <a href="about:blank#_specify_a_feature"></a> Specify a feature

It is possible to specify an entire application by supplying a prompt to the `/akka.specify` agent command, but it is not recommended. If your application is simple enough that it can be specified in a single prompt or file, use a single-file spec instead — the full spec-driven process is likely overkill for your needs.

To specify a new feature, use the following syntax from inside your AI agent:

```none
/akka.specify {feature short description} - {feature specification prompt}
```
The short description of the feature is turned into a branch name like `00#-feature-short-description` where the description you supply is converted to *kebab case*. This also becomes the name of the new git branch.

The prompt for the feature specification should exclusively define the *what* and *why* of the feature, and should not contain any technical implementation details. In the sample prompt below for a chess application core website, the prompt mentions that the app does not use federated authentication. While this seems like a *how* level (plan) declaration, it belongs at the higher specification level because the concept of federation is a high level specification — the prompt does not mention *how* federation should be coded.

| **/akka.specify** core users - *The chess application manages its own users. It does not integrate with federation technologies like OAuth. Users are uniquely identified by a username and they authenticate via password. Users can edit their profile and supply a friendly name and upload a small avatar image. Email verification is not used. Users can delete their own accounts. Users can view the profile of other users, but anonymous (not logged in) users cannot see any data.* |
This creates a new specification in the `specs/001-core-users` directory, in the `001-core-users` branch. At this stage, resist the temptation to go and manually edit the spec. Clarification is the next step.

There is no mention in this prompt of services or UI applications or how a web application is supposed to be served. Keep your feature specifications scoped to something small enough where you have a clear idea of the acceptance criteria and the generated code can easily be reviewed by humans or AI. Opinions vary on the scope of a "feature" so this is something teams generally decide amongst themselves and often on a per-feature basis.

### <a href="about:blank#_clarify_the_specification"></a> Clarify the specification

Clarification is a critical step in this process. Start it by using a single command with no parameters:

```none
/akka.clarify
```
Your AI assistant then analyzes your constitution, your feature specification, and any conversation history you have built up and identifies gaps. It looks for places where it would have to make a decision *and* it does not already have enough information to make that decision. If you run `akka.clarify` on the chess core users feature, you will likely be asked several questions.

Typical clarification questions include how users are uniquely identified (internal UUID or username), what happens to deleted users, and whether users can have multiple concurrent sessions from multiple devices. Achieving this level of clarity is a hallmark of spec-driven development that you rarely get with single-file specs or even less formal multi-file specifications.

Once your AI assistant can no longer detect any more necessary clarifications, it is time to define the implementation plan.

### <a href="about:blank#_define_the_implementation_plan"></a> Define the implementation plan

The implementation plan is your technical architecture and technical design. Here you specify the *how* of your application. While it is a popular notion that anyone can build a spec-driven application, this is not entirely accurate. You need to be able to decide how you want your application to be built, and you need to know how to describe that in natural language clear enough for an LLM to understand it.

If you get all the way to code generation for the feature and you did not get what you wanted, then you may need to iterate on the implementation plan. Amendments to the plan are tracked diligently along with constitution and feature updates.

It is worth remembering that, like the specify step, the input to the plan step is a *prompt*, not the full and final plan. Your agent produces the final plan as output.

Take a look at this sample plan prompt for the chess game sample first feature.

| **/akka.plan** *The implementation is an Akka service with both a static asset website user experience and the supporting RESTful API. The website uses simple JavaScript and not large frameworks like React. These assets are exposed via an HTTP endpoint with the resources in src/main/resources and served statically.*

*The website has a clean, professional look and uses tailwind CSS. The application logo should be a simple dark blue king chess piece. It should have a navigation bar on the top with access to login/logout/profile via a menu option in the top right of the nav.*

*The RESTful API is exposed via a separate HTTP endpoint. This API requires authentication for all operations except login. The authn/authz for these HTTP routes can be HTTP Basic and does not need to be anything more complex. Active user sessions are maintained via Key Value entities and are created upon login. This implies that a user will have a different session when logged in on a different device. A `TimedAction` is responsible for deleting sessions for users that have not submitted an API request after some timeout period. The RESTful API routes all start with a common `api/v1` prefix while the static UI assets use the root prefix and if no resource is specified on the URL then the index.html static resource file will be used. This page should be an empty placeholder for now, containing just a placeholder text and the top navigation bar.*

*The static assets will refer to the API via a full URL. This URL defaults to localhost on the current port, but can be overridden via the `CHESS_API_URL` environment variable available when running the service.* |
There is a balance between including something in your specification prompt and assuming that your AI assistant will infer other important items that need to be in the final plan. It is common to spend extra time iterating on the plan prompt to make sure that the plan output is correct. Thankfully the plan output is categorized by priority and functional requirements, making it easy to verify.

In other words: *make sure you agree with the functional requirements before continuing on to the next step*. If you want to add requirements to the plan, do so interactively with your agent and it will update the plan accordingly.

### <a href="about:blank#_generate_a_task_list"></a> Generate a task list

The next step toward a running feature is to generate a task list with `/akka.tasks`. This takes your clarified specification and your implementation plan and converts them into a formal set of work items. Your agent identifies which tasks should be done first and which ones can be done in parallel. If you are satisfied with the set of tasks generated, continue to the next step.

You can also provide updates to the task list here by discussing it with your agent.

### <a href="about:blank#_implement_the_code"></a> Implement the code

It is finally time to have your assistant write the code. When you use the `/akka.implement` command in your chat prompt, it creates your application code. Make sure that before you run this command, you are satisfied with the level of effort or "thought" being used by your agent. The results can vary drastically between medium and high effort levels.

During this step, it is common to see the agent make mistakes, generate compilation failures, and produce test failures. This is *normal* and the agent should be iterating toward the right answer. Only stop the agent in the middle of this step if you see something drastically wrong or you see the agent diverging from the solution over time instead of converging.

The default Akka constitution mandates both unit and integration tests, so these should also be generated and verified during this step.

When the code is complete, you should be able to exercise any RESTful APIs or user interfaces created. Akka makes this step easier as well.

### <a href="about:blank#_build_and_run_locally"></a> Build and run locally

You should never have to leave your agent chat during the spec-driven SDLC. If you use the `/akka.build` command, you get a ton of extra bonus features beyond a simple `mvn compile exec:java`.

- Pre-existing services are shut down
- Anything using the target port is shut down
- Your service is re-compiled and all tests are run
- Your service is launched
- Your service is *exercised through the real endpoints* to verify functionality. This is like building and exercising a custom Postman script or writing and using your own shell script, except it is easier and automated.
- The build command leaves your service running, so you can exercise it manually, including using the Akka console’s built-in request tracking.
- If you make changes to any of the documents, either from within or outside your agent chat, your service is recompiled and automatically restarted

### <a href="about:blank#_inspect_the_running_service"></a> Inspect the running service

Once your service is running — either locally after `/akka.build` or deployed via `/akka.deploy` — use the `/akka.inspect` command to verify it against your specification. Inspect exercises your service at runtime:

- Verifies the service is running and a feature spec exists
- Extracts API endpoints and entities from the spec
- Exercises API endpoints with test requests
- Verifies entity state via backoffice tools
- Validates the UI in the browser
- Summarizes findings and offers next steps
This is spec-driven *verification* — your agent checks that the running service actually behaves the way the specification says it should. If inspect finds issues, iterate with `/akka.implement` and `/akka.build` before deploying.

### <a href="about:blank#_deploy_to_akka"></a> Deploy to Akka

If you want to deploy your service to Akka’s infrastructure through *Akka Automated Operations*, use the `/akka.deploy` command. This command prompts you for the organization and project into which you want to deploy. It then seamlessly deploys your service, automatically doing a rolling update of the service cluster if one is already running. After deployment, the command verifies component health and inspects the deployed service using backoffice tools.

### <a href="about:blank#_review_and_analyze"></a> Review and analyze

Two additional commands help you maintain quality as your project evolves:

- `/akka.review` reviews the implemented code against the spec, plan, and constitution. Use this after implementation to catch deviations before they compound.
- `/akka.analyze` performs a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across your spec, plan, and task list. Use this after task generation to verify that all artifacts are aligned before implementation begins.

## <a href="about:blank#_specify_your_ideas"></a> Specify your ideas!

The greatest barrier to building new things is rarely the idea. It is usually in the implementation. Spec-Driven Development frees you from this barrier, letting you turn your ideas into specification and plan prompts, and watching as your agent generates and populates a to-do list and implements all of the code for you.

You no longer have to invest massive amounts of time in "what-if" scenarios — you can just *specify and go*. All you need is `init` → `specify` → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` → `build` → `inspect` → `deploy`.

Using SDD with careful feature scoping and concise technical implementation plans, you are never more than a matter of minutes from a feature you can interact with. With Akka, those features automatically become powerful, resilient, scalable distributed systems.
